# Caravel Board

This repo provides firmware examples, flash programming and diagnostic tools for testing
Open MPW and chipIgnite projects using Caravel.  It also provides schematics, layout and gerber files for PCB evaluation and breakout boards.

## Firmware

You will need python 3.6 or later.  

To program Caravel, connect the evaluation board using a USB micro B connector.

```bash
pip3 install pyftdi

cd firmware/blink

make clean flash
```
